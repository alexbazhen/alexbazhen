# 👋 Hello, I’m Alexander Bazhenov
I am glad to welcome you to my GitHub page!  
My name is Bazhenov Alexander or **@alexbazhen**. Now I am a **Junior Frontend Developer**.  
I've been a Web Developer for 5 years, including 4 years of commercial development. Basically, I develop turnkey websites 
(including the development of technical specifications, UX, UI, site layout and landing layout on CMS).   
My goal is to create user-oriented software by creating applications with a user-friendly and intuitive user interface. 
I also understand the importance of creating easily readable and easily maintained source code. 
I am constantly striving to learn new technologies and looking for ways to improve myself in this rapidly changing industry. In addition to development, I am also interested in web design.

## 📒 Education
The basis of my knowledge is self-study, however, to consolidate the material, 
I take various courses in web development, as well as regularly study MDN, LearnJS and expert articles on various resources.  
I have successfully completed several courses on HTML, CSS and JS on Udemy.  
I am currently taking an advanced JavaScript course at RS School and I already have good results.
> I previously studied at Petrozavodsk State University, but after 2 years I left because my field of study did not meet my expectations.
